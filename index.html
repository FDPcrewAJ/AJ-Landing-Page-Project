                WHY WE MADE THIS
            </h2>
            <p>
                A pair of pants for all day, everday. The perfect pants for life, work, and travel that can be worn more and washed less. Designed like a jean, but cut from innovative, extremely durable, stretch-nylon canvas they are both ligher and more durable than cotton denim. They shed water in a light rainstorm, and dry extremely fast when wet, and still looks great covered in desert dust, or city grime.
            </p>
            <p>
                We set out to engineer the best and most comfortable pair of outdoor/everyday/travel pants available.

                "I own - and constantly wear - two pairs of these suckers. The fit is exelent, like modern chinos, or jeans. The colors are just unique enough to stand out. But what I like most about them is how tough they are."
